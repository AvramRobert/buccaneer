=== Ideas ===
1.
Because commands are binary trees, can't I use a huffman encoding to serialise these trees as binary numbers and use this form as keys?

=== Experiments ===
1.
sbt-bolierplate for hlist => functionN conversion. I really don't want to enforce esoteric compiler plugins, but this is worth a test.
Based on my preliminary analysis, the way my API should behave might make this either impossible or very difficult to achieve.


=== To implement ===
1. Command component descriptions // done
2. Man page API
3. CLI DSL
4. Partial refactoring
5. Tests
6. Documentation
