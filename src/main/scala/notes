=== Ideas ===
1.
Because commands are binary trees, can't I use a huffman encoding to serialise these trees as binary numbers and use this form as keys?

2.
I may perhaps not really need `Tree`. Everything implemented so far is actually pretty linear.

=== To implement ===
1. Command component descriptions // done
2. Man page API // done
3. Partial refactoring
4. Tests
5. Documentation


=====================
It might be quite a good idea to let people configure their own MAN pages. Structure for help and such.
And more specifically, perhaps the commands that bring up help and suggestions.
