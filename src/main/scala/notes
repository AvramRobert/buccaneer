=== Ideas ===
1.
Compile time command arity check. Commands that are similar enough to pass the syntax checker and resolver should be excluded at compile time.
`Reified` is in itself a proof, that the input `String` is of, or can be converted to the given type. I might perhaps be able to use this
as an eager type check to further narrow down the command to be run.


=== Experiments ===
1.
sbt-bolierplate for hlist => functionN conversion. See Command.


=== To implement ===
1. Command and co. descriptions // done
2. Man page generation
3. Fully specify and enrich `Command`
4. Refactor and separate user interface from implementation details
5. Tests and laws
6. Documentation
