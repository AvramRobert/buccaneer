=== Ideas ===
1.
Because commands are binary trees, can't I use a huffman encoding to serialise these trees as binary numbers and use this form as keys?

2.
I may perhaps not really need `Tree`. Everything implemented so far is actually pretty linear.

=== To implement ===
1. Command component descriptions // done
2. Man page API // done
3. Partial refactoring // done
4. Tests
5. Documentation


=====================
Future features:

1. User-defined type-conditions // should be easy
2. User-defined meta-parametrisations // should be somewhat easy
3. Indexing errors by their positions while validating // should also be somewhat easy
